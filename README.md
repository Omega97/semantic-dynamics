# Semantic Dynamics


## Introduction

We introduce *Semantic Dynamics*, a framework that interprets the evolution of token sequences in large language models as a thermodynamic system, where semantic embeddings define an effective energy landscape and token generation follows stochastic trajectories in a latent state space. By modeling this process using tools from classical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics, we derive interpretable thermodynamic quantities—such as temperature, potential energy, and kinetic energy—from the model’s behavior, enabling the diagnosis and mitigation of pathological dynamics like looping or stuck states. Our approach provides a simple, practical *diagnostic tool* to estimate when a model is trapped in a semantic potential well and how to escape it by tuning an effective temperature, directly addressing the problem of repetition and periodic token cycles in LLMs.


Consider a corpus of text represented as a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{v} = (v_t)$, where each $v_t \in \mathcal{T}$ is drawn from a discrete vocabulary. Let $f: \mathcal{T}^N \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ be a semantic embedding function that maps a window of $N$ consecutive tokens $\mathbf{v}[t:t+N]$ to a point $q_t \in \mathcal{E}$ in a continuous semantic embedding space $\mathcal{E} \cong \mathbb{R}^d$. This point $q_t$ captures the meaning of the local context centered around position $t$. From this point on, the dependency on the vector of tokens $\mathbf{v}$ will be omitted from the notation, but always implied.

> **Key idea #1 — lifting the discrete embeddings $\mathbf q = (q_t)$ into a continuous trajectory $q(t)$:** We treat the discrete trajectory of the semantic vector as partial observations of the true position of an underlying continuous particle trajectory in embedding space $\mathcal E$ (see [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Continuum Semantic Trajectory Hypothesis|the Continuum Semantic Trajectory Hypothesis]] and the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Ergodic Hypothesis|Ergodic Hypothesis]]). This idea will allow us to study the distribution of embedding vectors as if they were a gas, through the lens of Statistical Mechanics.

We will see that a practical implementation of this step is not necessary.

So, let us now treat the token index $t$ as a continuous variable $t \in \mathbb{R}^+$, effectively *"lifting"* the discrete sequence into a continuous trajectory. By interpolating over time $t$ the discrete embeddings $q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])$ obtained in a *sliding window* fashion, we obtain a smooth curve $q(t): \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathcal{E}$. 

Differentiating this trajectory $q(t)$ yields the *semantic velocity*:
$$
\dot{q}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} q(t) \in T_{q}\mathcal{E},
$$
which captures the instantaneous rate and direction of semantic change at position $t$. The velocity, in turn, gives us the momentum:
$$
p(t) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}(q(t), \dot{q}(t), t)
$$
The Lagrangian relies implicitly on a notion of mass, or *"semantic inertia"*. It's not unreasonable to assume that $m$ is time-dependent. However, for the rest of the discussion, we will assume it is not (see the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Constant Inertia Hypothesis|Constant Inertia Hypothesis]]). Some topics or styles resist change more than others. A "heavy" semantic particle would represent a stable, coherent discourse that doesn’t shift meaning easily (e.g., a scientific argument). A "light" one might represent stream-of-consciousness or poetic language.

### Lagrangian Picture: Velocity and the Tangent Bundle

The dynamics of meaning can be studied in two geometrically natural spaces, corresponding to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics.

In the Lagrangian formulation, the local *state* representing the text at time $t$ is given by the pair:
$$
(q(t), \dot{q}(t)) \in T\mathcal{E}
$$
where $T\mathcal{E} = \bigsqcup_{q \in \mathcal{E}} T_q\mathcal{E}$ is the *tangent bundle of the embedding space. This space is the natural home for *velocity-based dynamics*, and we refer to it as the *semantic state space*. 

> **Key idea #2 — the semantic particle**: The trajectory $t \mapsto (q(t), \dot{q}(t))$ describes a "*semantic particle*" moving through the tangent bundle $T\mathcal{E}$. This picture closely resembles the idea of a particle moving through a potential landscape shaped by the semantics of the text. This analogy opens the door to analyzing linguistic dynamics using tools from **statistical mechanics** and **thermodynamics**—such as energy, entropy, temperature, and diffusion—by interpreting fluctuations in meaning and flow as physical-like processes.

---

### Hamiltonian Picture: Momentum and the Cotangent Bundle

To define the *canonical momentum*, we equip $\mathcal{E}$ with a Riemannian metric $g$, which in standard embeddings is the Euclidean inner product $g_q(u,v) = u^\top v$. The momentum at $q(t)$ is then the covector:
$$
p(t) = g_{q(t)}(\dot{q}(t), \cdot) \in T^*_{q(t)}\mathcal{E}
$$
which identifies ${p}(t)$ with a linear functional on tangent vectors. The full state now lives in the *cotangent bundle*:
$$
(q(t), p(t)) \in T^*\!\mathcal{E}
$$
We call this the *semantic phase space*—the proper domain for Hamiltonian dynamics. Although $p(t)$ and $m \ \dot{q}(t)$ coincide numerically under the Euclidean metric, they live in dual spaces: velocity in $T\mathcal{E}$, momentum in $T^*\!\mathcal{E}$. This distinction becomes essential when $\mathcal{E}$ is curved or equipped with a non-trivial metric (e.g., Fisher information).

If we, in fact, replace the Euclidean metric with the *Fisher information metric* derived from the underlying language model, then $g_q$ encodes how sensitive meaning is to perturbations in context, and momentum becomes curvature-aware. This yields a more faithful representation of semantic dynamics in non-uniform embedding spaces.

## Recovering the Thermodynamic Quantities

> **Key idea #3 — using the canonical ensemble**: With the geometric structure in place, we can define physical analogs to study text as a dynamical system. Starting from the density $\rho(q)$, we can write a recipe in the *canonical ensemble* to define all the relevant physical quantities from the text and from one another.


### Semantic Density $\rho(q)$

The probability density $\rho(q)$ plays a foundational role in the thermodynamic framework of semantic dynamics. It quantifies how frequently different regions of the embedding space $\mathcal{E}$ are occupied by the *semantic point*. In this context, $\rho(q)$ is not merely a statistical artifact—it represents the *empirical likelihood of encountering a particular semantic state* $q$ throughout the text. High-density regions correspond to common, coherent, or stylistically typical meanings (e.g., standard syntactic patterns, frequent topics), while low-density areas represent rare, idiosyncratic, or disfluent constructions. This makes $\rho(q)$ a direct proxy for *semantic plausibility*, and through the relation $V(q) = -\frac{1}{\beta} \, \log \rho(q)$, it defines the underlying potential landscape that governs the motion of the semantic particle.

> **Key idea #4 — how to estimate the distribution of embeddings $\rho$**: To estimate $\rho(q)$ *empirically* from real text, we treat the sequence of sliding-window embeddings $q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])$ as samples from an unknown distribution. Several methods can be used, for example *Kernel Density Estimation* (KDE), *Gaussian Mixture Model* (GMM), or *$k$-Nearest Neighbors Density Estimation (k-NN DE)*. Since we assume equilibrium (see the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Equilibrium Hypothesis|Equilibrium Hypothesis]]), likelihood-based analysis can help validate the estimated distribution.

When applying this framework to real data, it is imperative to verify that the metric and density choices don’t arbitrarily change the *physics* of the system.


#### Algorithm for Estimating the Density $\rho$

 1. Evaluate the list of embeddings $q=(q_t)$ with your embedding model: 
$$
q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])
$$
    
 2. Optional: Apply a dimensionality reduction technique, like PCA.
    
 3. Finally, to estimate $\rho(q)$, apply a density estimation technique, like KDE, GMM, or k-NN DE.


# Dimensionality $d$

The dimension $d$ of the embedding space $\mathcal{E}$ is a key parameter in the thermodynamic framework, appearing in fundamental quantities such as temperature and the partition function. While the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^d$, the actual dynamics of language are likely confined to a lower-dimensional submanifold due to inherent constraints in grammar, topic coherence, and style.

To account for this, we bring the attention to an important concept — dimensionality reduction: the empirical distribution of embedding vectors $\rho(q)$ can be well-approximated in a reduced space. We define a smooth map $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a lower-dimensional manifold (e.g., $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{eff}}}$ with $d_{\text{eff}} \ll d$). This projection, such as one obtained via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), autoencoders, or UMAP, identifies the most significant directions of variation in the semantic trajectory $q(t)$

> **Key idea #5 — dimensionality reduction**: To ease the estimation of $\rho(q)$, we may assume that it can be approximated by a lower-dimensional manifold. In this case, we should also update $d$ to be the number of principal components. PCA, or any other reasonable *dimensionality reduction* technique, can help us get rid of the less informative degrees of freedom.  

The projected trajectory $q_{\mathcal{M}}(t) = \pi(q(t))$ evolves in $\mathcal{M}$, and all thermodynamic quantities are computed with respect to this reduced space. In particular, the effective dimension $d_{\text{eff}} = \dim(\mathcal{M})$ replaces $d$ in formulas involving phase space volume, ensuring that equipartition and density estimation reflect only the dynamically active degrees of freedom.

Using $d_{\text{eff}}$ mitigates the curse of dimensionality in density estimation and ensures that thermodynamic quantities are not diluted across irrelevant or noisy dimensions. However, whether this reduction is explicitly implemented or not does not alter the theoretical structure of the framework. Throughout this document, $d$ should be understood as the *effective dimension* of the semantic manifold—the true number of independent ways in which meaning can evolve—regardless of the nominal size of the embedding space.


### Semantic Volume $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$

To extend the thermodynamic analogy beyond energy and entropy, we introduce the concept of *semantic volume*, denoted $V_{\text{sem}}$. This quantity represents the effective extent of the embedding space $\mathcal{E} \cong \mathbb{R}^d$ that is dynamically explored by the semantic particle over time. Formally, it is defined as the $d$-dimensional volume of the region in $\mathcal{E}$ where the probability density $\rho(q)$ of encountering a meaningful state is non-negligible:
$$
\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}} = \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; \chi_{\epsilon}(q)
$$
where $\chi(q)$ is a characteristic function (or smoothed indicator) that selects points $q$ for which $\rho(q) > \epsilon$, for some small threshold $\epsilon > 0$. Alternatively, $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$ can be estimated via the support of the empirical distribution of embedding vectors, or as the volume of a level set $\{ q \mid V(q) \leq E \}$ for a given energy $E$.

Unlike physical volume, which is confined to three spatial dimensions, $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$ generalizes the notion of "available space" to the $d$-dimensional abstract space of meaning. A large $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$ indicates a text that explores a broad range of topics or styles, while a small $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$ suggests a narrow, focused discourse.

This generalization is mathematically consistent with statistical mechanics, where phase space volumes are routinely defined in high-dimensional spaces. The semantic volume plays the same thermodynamic role as physical volume: it serves as the conjugate variable to pressure, and it governs the system's capacity for expansion in meaning space, though by itself may not be very informative.

#### Algorithm for Volume $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$

 1. Decide a threshold $\epsilon > 0$
    
 2. Estimate $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$ by finding the region of embedding space $\mathcal E$ where $\rho$ is greater than $\epsilon$, by leveraging any parametrization possibly used for $\rho(z)$, or with a Monte Carlo method
$$
\boxed{\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}} = \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; \chi_{\epsilon}(q)}
$$


### Potential Energy $V(q)$

The potential $V(q)$ represents a semantic landscape that guides the dynamics of meaning in text. It is a scalar field on $\mathcal{E}$ representing semantic "landscape" features—e.g., topic attractors, conceptual basins, or stylistic preferences. It can be recovered using the empirical density of the discrete semantic vectors in the corpus (e.g., via *kernel density estimation*). Under the Gibbs-Boltzmann hypothesis (see the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Ergodic Hypothesis|Ergodic Hypothesis]]), at equilibrium we simply have:
$$
V(q, \beta) = - \frac{1}{\beta} \, \log \rho(q)
$$
where the system is at temperature $T = \frac{1}{k_B \, \beta}$ (with Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1$, as justified by the use of natural units in an abstract semantic space), and $\beta$ is called the *inverse temperature*. We have to fix the inverse temperature in place because, in thermodynamics, knowing only the spatial density $\rho(q)$ is not enough to fix the temperature. 


#### Recipe for the Potential Energy $V$

 1. Compute the embedding trajectory $q(t)$ via sliding window and interpolation
    
 2. Estimate $\rho(q)$ via any preferred method (e.g., via KDE, GMM, k-NN DE, ...)
    
 3. Compute the potential energy: 
$$
\boxed{V(q, T) = - T \, \log \rho(q)}
$$

The potential energy makes high-density regions look like low-potential "semantic basins." In principle, we can use this simple equation to estimate the semantic potential energy landscape that partially governs our system. 


### Hamiltonian

- **Kinetic energy** (velocity form):  
$$
E_{\text{kin}}(t) = \frac{1}{2} m\,\|\dot{q}(t)\|^2_g
$$
- **Momentum form** Hamiltonian: 
$$
E_{\text{kin}}(t) = \frac{1}{2\,m} \|p(t)\|^2_{g^{-1}}
$$
where the $g^{-1}$ is a direct consequence of the duality between the velocity vector and the momentum covector. Combining the two equations, we get the Hamiltonian of the system:  
$$
H(q,p) = \frac{1}{2\,m} \|p\|^2_{g^{-1}} + V(q)
$$

### Partition Function $Z(\beta)$

To transition from deterministic dynamics to statistical behavior, we introduce the *partition function*, the cornerstone of equilibrium statistical mechanics (see the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Equilibrium Hypothesis|Equilibrium Hypothesis]]). It aggregates the contributions of all possible semantic states $(q, p)$, weighted by their likelihood under the Hamiltonian $H(q, p)$.

Assuming the system is in thermal equilibrium, the canonical partition function is defined as:
$$
Z(\beta) = \int_{T^{*}\mathcal{E}} dq\,dp \; e^{-\beta H(q,p)}
$$
Here, the integral is taken over the full *semantic phase space* $T^*\!\mathcal{E}$, and $dq\,dp$ denotes the standard Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d$, which coincides with the Liouville volume form in the Euclidean case.

Substituting the Hamiltonian
$$
H(q,p) = \frac{1}{2m} \|p\|^2 + V(q)
$$
and assuming the metric is Euclidean (so $\|p\|^2 = p^\top p$), we can factor the integral:
$$
Z(\beta) = \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} dp \; e^{-\beta \frac{\|p\|^2}{2m}} \right) \left( \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)} \right)
$$

The momentum integral is a Gaussian:
$$
\int dq \; e^{-\beta \frac{\|p\|^2}{2m}} = \left( \frac{2\pi m}{\beta} \right)^{d/2}
$$
The partition function becomes:
$$
Z(\beta) = \left( \frac{2\pi m}{\beta} \right)^{d/2} \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)}
$$
Finally, we can substitute in the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_B=\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{2 \pi m}}$, to get:
$$
Z(\beta) = \frac{1}{\lambda_B^d} \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)}
$$
This expression links the global statistical properties of the text to the *geometry of the semantic potential* $V(q)$. Regions of low $V(q)$ (high topic density) dominate the integral at low temperatures, while high temperatures lead to uniform exploration.


### Free energy $F(\beta)$

From the partition function, we derive the *Helmholtz free energy*, which governs the thermodynamic balance between energy and uncertainty:
$$
F(\beta) = -\frac{1}{\beta} \, \log Z(\beta)
$$
The free energy represents the available work or effective cost of maintaining a coherent semantic trajectory at temperature $T = 1/\beta$. It combines the average energy of the system with an entropic penalty for diversity:
$$
F = \langle H \rangle - T S
$$
Minimizing $F$ corresponds to finding the optimal trade-off between *semantic coherence* (low potential energy) and *expressive diversity* (high entropy). In language, this reflects how a text navigates between staying on-topic and exploring related ideas.

#### Recipe for the Free Energy $F$

 1. Estimate the partition function (by leveraging any parametrization possibly used for $\rho(z)$, or with a Monte Carlo method).
$$
Z(T) = \frac{1}{\lambda_B^d} \int_{\mathcal{E}} dq \; e^{-\frac{V(q)}{T}}
$$
    
 2. Use the following formula:
$$
\boxed{F(T) = -T \, \log Z}
$$


### Internal Energy $U$

The internal energy—the *average semantic energy*—is obtained from the partition function via:
$$
U = \langle H \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \, \log Z(\beta)
$$
Using the factorized form of $Z(\beta)$, we compute:
$$
\log Z(\beta) = \frac{d}{2} \log(2\pi m) - \frac{d}{2} \log \beta + \log \left( \int dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)} \right)
$$
so
$$
U = \langle H \rangle = \frac{d}{2\beta} + \frac{ \int dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)} V(q)}{ \int dq \; e^{-\beta V(q)}} = \langle K \rangle + \langle V \rangle
$$
This recovers the *equipartition theorem*: the average kinetic energy is
$$
\langle K \rangle = \frac{d}{2} T
$$
On the other hand, the average potential energy $\langle V \rangle$ depends on the shape of $V(q)$ and the temperature. At low $T$, $\langle V \rangle$ approaches the global minimum of $V(q)$; at high $T$, it flattens toward the average over $\mathcal{E}$.

This allows us to *measure semantic temperature* directly from observed kinetic energy: a text with high $\|\dot{q}(t)\|$ variance is "hot"; one that stays near a topic center is "cold".


#### Recipe for the Internal Energy $U$

 1. Compute the average potential energy $\braket V$ (again, by leveraging any parametrization possibly used for $\rho(z)$, or with a *Monte Carlo* method)
    
 2. Compute the average kinetic energy 
$$
\langle K \rangle = \frac{d}{2} \; T
$$
 3. Add them together to obtain 
$$
\boxed{U(T) = \braket K + \braket V}
$$


### Entropy $S$

The *Gibbs entropy* quantifies the uncertainty or diversity of semantic states of the ensemble. It is defined as the expectation of the negative log-density:
$$
S = -\int dq\,dp\, \rho(q,p) \log \rho(q,p)
$$
where the equilibrium distribution is
$$
\rho(q,p) = \frac{1}{Z(\beta)} e^{-\beta H(q,p)}
$$
Substituting this in, we find:
$$
S = \beta \langle H \rangle + \log Z(\beta) = \frac{\langle H \rangle - F}{T}
$$
Alternatively, using the definition $S = -\partial F / \partial T$, we can compute entropy directly from the free energy.

High entropy corresponds to *semantic diversity*—a text that explores many topics or styles. Low entropy indicates *focus or redundancy*, such as repetitive reasoning or narrow discourse. This makes entropy a natural metric for analyzing genre, authorial style, or model behavior.

#### Formula for the Entropy $S$

$$
\boxed{S(T) = \frac{U(T) - F(T)}{T}}
$$


### Semantic Pressure $P$

Building on the definition of $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$, we define *semantic pressure* $P$ as the thermodynamic conjugate of volume in the canonical ensemble. It quantifies the tendency of the semantic system to expand its scope of meaning in response to confinement.

In the canonical ensemble, the partition function $Z(\beta, \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}})$ depends on both the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/T$ and the accessible semantic volume. The semantic pressure is then given by:
$$
P(\beta) = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}} \log Z(\beta, \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}})
$$
This measures how sensitive the system's free energy is to changes in the available semantic space. A high $P$ indicates strong resistance to confinement—a "drive" to explore new meanings—while a low $P$ suggests contentment within a limited conceptual domain.

For a free semantic particle (i.e., $V(q) = 0$) in $d$ dimensions with Euclidean metric, the partition function factorizes as:
$$
Z(\beta, \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}) = \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}} \left( \frac{2\pi m}{\beta} \right)^{d/2} = \frac{\mathcal{V_{sem}}}{\lambda_B^{d}}
$$
Then:
$$
\log Z = \log \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}} + \frac{d}{2} \log(2\pi m) - \frac{d}{2} \log \beta
$$
and so:
$$
P = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}} = \frac{1}{\beta \; \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}}
$$
This yields the *semantic ideal gas law:
$$
P \; \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}} = T
$$
which expresses a fundamental trade-off: at fixed temperature $T$, reducing $V_{\text{sem}}$ increases $P$. This reflects a *creative tension*—a confined but agitated text "pushes" against its boundaries.

#### Formula for Pressure $P$

Empirically, $P$ can be estimated as:
$$
\boxed{P(T) \approx \frac{T}{\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}}}
$$
where $T = \frac{2}{d} \langle K \rangle$ is the semantic temperature and $V_{\text{sem}}$ is computed from the support of $q(t)$. Applications include detecting narrative build-up (rising $P$) or diagnosing stagnation (low $P$ despite high $T$).

Thus, *semantic pressure* completes the core thermodynamic triad—$T$, $S$, $P$—and enables a richer analysis of linguistic dynamics as a driven, expansive process.


### Specific Heat $C_V$

The specific heat at constant volume, denoted $C_V$, is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that measures the system’s ability to absorb energy in response to a change in temperature. In physical systems, it characterizes thermal inertia; in our framework, it quantifies the resistance of a semantic system to changes in agitation (temperature).

We define $C_V$ as the rate of change of the average energy with respect to temperature:
$$
C_V = \frac{\partial \langle H \rangle}{\partial T}
$$
Since we work in units where the Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1$, this is dimensionally consistent.

From statistical mechanics, the average energy is:
$$
\langle H \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \log Z(\beta)
$$
Then, using the chain rule:
$$
C_V = \frac{\partial \langle H \rangle}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial \langle H \rangle}{\partial \beta} \cdot \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial T} = \left( -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta^2} \log Z(\beta) \right) \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{T^2} \right)
$$
Thus:
$$
C_V = \frac{1}{T^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta^2} \log Z(\beta)
$$
But the second derivative of $\log Z$ is also the variance of the energy:
$$
\mathrm{Var}(H) = \langle H^2 \rangle - \langle H \rangle^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta^2} \log Z(\beta)
$$
So we obtain:
$$
C_V = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(H)}{T^2}
$$
This is a key result in *Statistical Mechanics*: the specific heat is proportional to the fluctuations in energy.

As for interpretation, a high $C_V$ suggests that the system can absorb large changes in temperature with minimal disruption to its average energy — it is *thermally stable*. On the other hand, a low $C_V$ means the system is sensitive to temperature changes — small increases in $T$ cause large increases in $\langle H \rangle$, indicating *semantic fragility*. In linguistic terms, a coherent, well-structured text (e.g., a logical argument) may have high $C_V$: it resists thermal agitation and maintains stability even as $T$ increases.

#### Recipe for the Specific Heat $C_V$

 1. Compute $\mathrm{Var}(H)= \langle H^2 \rangle - \langle H \rangle^2$
    
 2. Compute the specific heat:
$$
\boxed{C_V(T) = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(H)}{T^2}}
$$

## Locking Everything into Place 

We managed, so far, to express several physical quantities as a function of temperature $T$. If we could measure even one of them, we would be able to lock the temperature, and thus, every other quantity.


### Method 1 — Measuring Average Kinetic Energy

We can measure the average kinetic energy, $\braket K$, by first calculating the instantaneous kinetic energy at each point along the semantic trajectory and then averaging these values.

The instantaneous kinetic energy at a specific point in time t is defined as:
$$
K​(t)=\frac{1}{2} ​m\|\dot q(t)\|_{g}^2​
$$

#### How to Find the Temperature $T$

1. **Generate the Embedding Trajectory** $\mathbf q = (q_t)$, where $q_t​=f(\mathbf v[t:t+N])$
    
2. **Calculate Semantic Velocity** $\dot q(t)$, which is the discrete time derivative of the position vector $\mathbf q$. Notice how this is the first time we actually have to compute any derivative. Though we should carefully consider the *Brownian* nature of the system, you can try to approximate the $\dot q(t)$ using a finite difference, such as:
$$
\dot q_t​ \approx q_{t+1}​−q_t​
$$
    
3. **Calculate Instantaneous Kinetic Energy**: 
$$
K​_t=\frac{1}{2} ​m\|\dot q_t\|_{g}^2
$$
    
4. **Average the Results**: 
$$
\braket K = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N K_t
$$
    
 5. Compute the temperature:
$$
\boxed {T=\frac {d}{2} \braket K}
$$ 

Though this method is the most obvious choice to find the temperature, and therefore all the other thermodynamical quantities, it is susceptible to the choice of the discrete time derivative algorithm, which, in the context of *Brownian motion* may be ill-defined. 

### Method 2 — Measuring Entropy

> **Key idea #6 — locking everything into place**: By estimating the entropy of the system with the *Lempel-Ziv Complexity*, $S(T) \approx S_{LZ}$, and inverting the formula for entropy, we can obtain the temperature $\hat T=T(S_{LZ})$. Finally, we plug our estimate of the temperature $\hat T$ into all the other quantities to lock them into place (see the [[Semantic Dynamics - Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles#Hypothesis on Entropy|Hypothesis on Entropy]]).

#### How to Find the Temperature $T$

 1. Find $S(T)$ as previously described
    
 2. Invert the formula to get $T(S)$
    
 3. Estimate $S$ with the *Lempel-Ziv Complexity* 
$$
S(T) \approx S_{LZ}
$$
    
 4. Estimate the temperature:  
$$
\hat T=T(S_{LZ})
$$
Now you may go back and plug this value of the temperature to get the estimate of all other thermodynamical quantities.

## Hypotheses


### Ergodic Hypothesis

> **Time averages along a single trajectory equal ensemble averages over phase space.**

In physics, the long-time trajectory of a system explores all accessible regions of phase space uniformly, so the average of a quantity over time equals its average over all possible states.
Similarly, in semantics, we assume that the evolution $(q(t), p(t))$ of a single long text (e.g., a novel) samples the full distribution of semantic states characteristic of its genre, author, or theme.

This is crucial for empirical work: it allows us to treat one book as a proxy for the "statistical behavior" of a writer or genre. Importantly, real texts may violate ergodicity (e.g., narratives have irreversible arcs, authors shift style), suggesting *non-equilibrium statistical mechanics* may be more appropriate in some cases.


### Equal A-Priori Probability Hypothesis

> **In equilibrium, all accessible microstates consistent with the system’s energy and constraints are equally probable.**

In physics, for an isolated system in equilibrium, the probability density $\rho(q,p)$ is uniform over the energy shell $H(q,p) = E$. Equivalently, in semantics, over a long text or corpus in a "stationary" semantic regime (e.g., consistent topic or style), all meaning states that are semantically coherent and dynamically accessible should be equally likely under the model.

This justifies using the *microcanonical ensemble*, where entropy is defined as:
$$
S = k_B \log \Omega
$$
with $\Omega$ the volume of phase space occupied by states at fixed energy.


### Continuum Semantic Trajectory Hypothesis

> **The trajectory of the semantic vector can be treated as a partial observation of an underlying continuous trajectory.**

By interpolating over time $t$ the discrete embeddings $q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])$ obtained in a sliding window fashion, we get a smooth curve $q(t): \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathcal{E}$. The assumption that this *lifting* can be done without changing the trajectory in a meaningful way opens the door to computing the *momentum* of the particle, which in turn will unlock all the operators and functionals used in *Lagrangian mechanics*.


### Equilibrium Hypothesis

> **We assume that the gas we are studying is at equilibrium. In principle, equilibrium occurs when the distribution of embeddings $\rho$ of any (reasonably) small portion of the text is similar to the distribution of the entire corpus.**

This hypothesis may not hold in general, and it's an interesting question whether it may be relaxed. In any case, to improve the stability, it should be a good idea to split the text based on meaning and study each chunk individually. 


### Constant Inertia Hypothesis

> **The mass of the semantic particle is constant.**

This hypothesis is necessary to study the system with the tools of *Statistical Mechanics*. 


### Hypothesis on Entropy

> To lock the value of temperature into place through entropy, we assume that we can measure the entropy of the system directly from the list of tokens with the *Lempel-Ziv Complexity*, $S(T) \approx S_{LZ}$.

This bridge between the two types of entropy is just an approximation, and, in the future, a better trick may be found to lock the thermodynamic quantities into place.

### Diffusion and Stochastic Dynamics

The concept of noise is highly relevant in this context for two main reasons. First, natural language has a significant level of stochasticity. Second, LLMs use noise to make the output text more *creative*, *diverse*, and perhaps *realistic*. 

In this context, Brownian motion comes to mind. To model noise, drift, or stylistic variation, we can introduce a *stochastic differential equation* on the tangent bundle:
$$
d q(t) = \dot{q}(t)\,dt, \quad d\dot{q}(t) = F(q,\dot{q})\,dt + \sigma\, dW_t
$$
where $F$ represents deterministic forces (e.g., gradient of $-V$), and $W_t$ is a Wiener process. This leads to a *Fokker–Planck equation* for the evolution of $\rho(q,\dot{q},t)$, describing how semantic uncertainty spreads over time.


### Why do LLMs Tend to get Stuck?

We now have a framework to study the phenomenon of LLMs repeating periodically the same output token over and over again. If we add more noise to the output, it tends to do that less often, suggesting a notion of *potential well* and *kinetic energy*. 

> **Key idea #7 — studying LLMs with thermodynamics**: We propose, that by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of the text right before the *periodic token* occurs, it should be possible to suggest a safety threshold for model temperature $T_{crit}$.

#### Recipe for $T_{crit}$

 1. Use the text generated by the LLM to study $K_{\text avg}(T^{(model)})$
    
 2. Use the examples of text with a *looping token* to estimate both the depth $\hat V$ of the average problematic potential well, **and** the average kinetic energy $\hat K$ in that moment.
    
 3. Invert the formula of point 1 to get $T^{(model)}(K_{\text avg})$. Then, estimate the critical temperature for the model, which is the temperature when the kinetic energy is expected to be equal to the potential energy:
$$
K_{\text crit} = \hat V
$$
$$
 T_{\text{crit}} = T^{(model)}(K_{\text crit})
$$

## Conclusion

We have shown that *Semantic Dynamics* provides a powerful and interpretable framework for analyzing and improving language model behavior through the lens of *Statistical Mechanics*. By mapping token transitions to trajectories in a latent energy landscape, we derived effective thermodynamic quantities—temperature, kinetic energy, and potential depth—from semantic embeddings, enabling the quantification of when a model becomes trapped in repetitive cycles. Our simple yet principled implementation allows for the estimation of a critical temperature $T_{crit}$​, above which the model’s kinetic energy overcomes confining potential wells, breaking free from loops. These results demonstrate that thermodynamic principles can guide both the diagnosis and control of degenerate generation, offering a new path toward more coherent, diverse, and stable language model outputs.

## Other Ideas

**Canonical Transformations**:
- In the Hamiltonian picture, apply transformations $(q,p) \mapsto (Q,P)$ that preserve $\omega$. Useful for style transfer, paraphrasing, or aligning texts across domains.

**Semantic Potential Landscapes**:  
- Map long-form documents (e.g., novels, essays) into energy landscapes; identify **potential wells** (topic clusters) and **barriers** (transitions between themes).

**Semantic Turbulence**:  
- Analyze the power spectrum of $p(t)$ or $\dot{q}(t)$; high-frequency components may indicate cognitive load, emotional intensity, or stylistic complexity.
