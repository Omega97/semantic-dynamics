_Please read the [article](https://github.com/Omega97/semantic-dynamics/blob/main/Semantic_Dynamics.pdf) that I'm working on. Thank you!_


**Semantic Dynamics—Key Takeaways**

- **Continuous-trajectory lens:** Discrete token embeddings are viewed as samples of a smooth path in semantic space, letting us import concepts like velocity and momentum.
    
- **“Semantic particle” analogy:** The evolving embedding acts like a particle moving through a meaning landscape; classical mechanics (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) provides the language to describe its state.
    
- **Thermodynamic map:** Empirical embedding densities define a potential; kinetic motion plus this potential yield temperature, energy, entropy, pressure, and specific heat—practical signals of coherence, diversity, and stability.
    
- **Hybrid density estimation:** High-variance principal components get a flexible mixture model while the noisy tail is treated as Gaussian, giving tractable yet accurate estimates of the semantic density that anchors all thermodynamic quantities.
    
- **Diagnostics for LLM pathologies:** By tracking kinetic energy and a learned friction rate, the framework flags when generation drops below a critical temperature—predicting or preventing repetitive looping—and suggests nudging model temperature or noise to escape semantic wells.
