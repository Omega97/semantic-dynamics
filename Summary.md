### **Summary: Semantic Dynamics — A Thermodynamic Framework for Language**

We propose **Semantic Dynamics**, a novel framework that models the evolution of text as the motion of a "semantic particle" in a continuous embedding space, governed by principles from **classical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics**.

By treating a sequence of token embeddings as a trajectory $q(t)$ in $\mathcal{E} \cong \mathbb{R}^d$, we define:
- **Semantic velocity**: $\dot{q}(t) = dq/dt$, the rate of meaning change,
- **Momentum and mass**: $p(t) = m \dot{q}(t)$, where $m$ represents *semantic inertia* (resistance to change),
- **Phase space**: $(q(t), p(t)) \in T^*\!\mathcal{E}$, enabling Hamiltonian dynamics.

From this, we derive a full **thermodynamic interpretation** of language:
- **Potential energy $V(q)$**: Defined as $V(q) = -T \log \rho(q)$, where $\rho(q)$ is the empirical density of embedding states. This creates a *semantic landscape* with "topic wells" and "conceptual barriers".
- **Temperature $T$**: Measured from kinetic energy via $\langle K \rangle = \frac{d}{2} T$, providing a **quantitative thermometer for linguistic agitation**.
- **Entropy, free energy, pressure, and specific heat**: All derived from the partition function $Z(\beta)$, enabling a complete statistical description.

#### 🔍 Key Insights

> **Key idea #1 — lifting the discrete embeddings $\mathbf q = (q_t)$ into a continuous trajectory $q(t)$:** We treat the discrete trajectory of the semantic vector as partial observations of the true position of an underlying continuous particle trajectory in embedding space $\mathcal E$. This idea will allow us to study the distribution of embedding vectors as if they were a gas, through the lens of Statistical Mechanics.

> **Key idea #2 — the semantic particle**: The trajectory $t \mapsto (q(t), \dot{q}(t))$ describes a "*semantic particle*" moving through the tangent bundle $T\mathcal{E}$. This picture closely resembles the idea of a particle moving through a potential landscape shaped by the semantics of the text. This analogy opens the door to analyzing linguistic dynamics using tools from **statistical mechanics** and **thermodynamics**—such as energy, entropy, temperature, and diffusion—by interpreting fluctuations in meaning and flow as physical-like processes.

> **Key idea #3 — using the canonical ensemble**: With the geometric structure in place, we can define physical analogs to study text as a dynamical system. Starting from the density $\rho(q)$, we can write a recipe in the *canonical ensemble* to define all the relevant physical quantities from the text and from one another.

> **Key idea #4 — how to estimate the distribution of embeddings $\rho$**: To estimate $\rho(q)$ *empirically* from real text, we treat the sequence of sliding-window embeddings $q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])$ as samples from an unknown distribution. Several methods can be used, for example *Kernel Density Estimation* (KDE), *Gaussian Mixture Model* (GMM), or *$k$-Nearest Neighbors Density Estimation (k-NN DE)*. Since we assume equilibrium, likelihood-based analysis can help validate the estimated distribution.

> **Key idea #5 — dimensionality reduction**: To ease the estimation of $\rho(q)$, we may assume that it can be approximated by a lower-dimensional manifold. In this case, we should also update $d$ to be the number of principal components. PCA, or any other reasonable *dimensionality reduction* technique, can help us get rid of the less informative degrees of freedom.  

> **Key idea #6 — locking everything into place**: By estimating the entropy of the system with the *Lempel-Ziv Complexity*, $S(T) \approx S_{LZ}$, and inverting the formula for entropy, we can obtain the temperature $\hat T=T(S_{LZ})$. Finally, we plug our estimate of the temperature $\hat T$ into all the other quantities to lock them into place.

> **Key idea #7 — studying LLMs with thermodynamics**: We propose, that by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of the text right before the *periodic token* occurs, it should be possible to suggest a safety threshold for model temperature $T_{crit}$.


#### 🎯 Why This Matters

This framework unifies embedding-based NLP with the deep structure of statistical mechanics — turning language into a **dynamical system we can measure, model, and control**. It may also provide a new lens to monitor and improve LLM behavior.
