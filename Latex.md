\title{Semantic Dynamics: \ Studying the Thermodynamics of Semantic Particles}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce \textit{Semantic Dynamics}, a framework that interprets the evolution of token sequences in large language models as a thermodynamic system. Semantic embeddings define an effective energy landscape, and token generation follows stochastic trajectories in a latent state space. Using tools from classical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics, we derive interpretable quantities—such as temperature, potential energy, and kinetic energy—from model behavior. This enables the diagnosis and mitigation of pathological dynamics like looping or stuck states. Our approach provides a practical diagnostic tool to estimate when a model is trapped in a semantic potential well and how to escape it by tuning an effective temperature, directly addressing repetition and periodic token cycles in LLMs.

By modeling linguistic evolution as the motion of a ``semantic particle'' through a continuous embedding space, we unlock a physical-like interpretation of meaning change—where fluctuations in semantics resemble physical processes such as diffusion, inertia, and thermal agitation. This analogy allows us to quantify coherence, diversity, and stability in generated text using thermodynamic observables.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Consider a corpus of text represented as a sequence of tokens $\vect{v} = (v_t)$, where each $v_t \in \mathcal{T}$ is drawn from a discrete vocabulary. Let $f: \mathcal{T}^N \to \E$ be a semantic embedding function that maps a window of $N$ consecutive tokens $\vect{v}[t:t+N]$ to a point $q_t \in \E \cong \mathbb{R}^d$ in a continuous semantic embedding space $\E$. This point $q_t$ captures the meaning of the local context centered around position $t$. From now on, the dependency on $\vect{v}$ is implied but omitted.

The central insight of this work is that the discrete sequence of semantic embeddings $\vect{q} = (q_t)$ can be treated not just as isolated points, but as partial observations of an underlying continuous trajectory—akin to tracking the position of a particle moving through an abstract space of meaning. This opens the door to analyzing linguistic dynamics using the full machinery of classical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics.

\subsection{Key Idea \#1: Continuum Semantic Trajectory Hypothesis}
We treat the discrete sequence of embeddings $\vect{q} = (q_t)$ as partial observations of an underlying continuous trajectory $q(t): \mathbb{R}^+ \to \E$. By interpolating the discrete embeddings $q_t = f(\vect{v}[t:t+N])$ obtained via a sliding window, we obtain a smooth curve $q(t)$.

Differentiating this trajectory yields the \textit{semantic velocity}:
\[
\dot{q}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} q(t) \in T_q\E,
\]
which captures the instantaneous rate and direction of semantic change—the ``flow of meaning'' at position $t$. The velocity leads to the \textit{momentum}:
\[
p(t) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}(q(t), \dot{q}(t), t),
\]
where the Lagrangian $L$ implicitly depends on a notion of \textit{semantic inertia} $m$. While $m$ may vary—scientific texts resist change more than poetic ones—we assume constant inertia for simplicity (see \textit{Constant Inertia Hypothesis}).

This lifting of discrete tokens into a continuous dynamical system allows us to compute momentum and unlock the full suite of operators from Lagrangian mechanics. As we will see, this geometric perspective transforms abstract language into a physical-like process governed by energy, force, and entropy.

\section{Lagrangian Picture: Velocity and the Tangent Bundle}
In the Lagrangian formulation, the state at time $t$ is given by:
\[
(q(t), \dot{q}(t)) \in T\E,
\]
where $T\E = \bigsqcup_{q \in \E} T_q\E$ is the \textit{tangent bundle} of the embedding space. This is the natural space for velocity-based dynamics, which we call the \textit{semantic state space}.

\subsection{Key Idea \#2: The Semantic Particle}
The trajectory $t \mapsto (q(t), \dot{q}(t))$ describes a ``semantic particle'' moving through $T\E$, analogous to a physical particle in a potential landscape shaped by semantics. This picture closely resembles the idea of a particle evolving under forces derived from meaning coherence and contextual stability.

This analogy opens the door to analyzing linguistic dynamics using tools from statistical mechanics—energy, entropy, temperature, and diffusion—as physical-like processes. Fluctuations in meaning, shifts in topic, and even stylistic variation can be interpreted as manifestations of kinetic energy, thermal agitation, and drift in a high-dimensional space of ideas.

\section{Hamiltonian Picture: Momentum and the Cotangent Bundle}
Equip $\E$ with a Riemannian metric $g$, typically the Euclidean inner product $g_q(u,v) = u^\top v$. The momentum is then the covector:
\[
p(t) = g_{q(t)}(\dot{q}(t), \cdot) \in T^*_{q(t)}\E,
\]
which identifies $p(t)$ with a linear functional on tangent vectors. The full state now lives in the \textit{cotangent bundle}:
\[
(q(t), p(t)) \in T^*\E,
\]
called the \textit{semantic phase space}—the domain for Hamiltonian dynamics.

Although $p(t)$ and $m \dot{q}(t)$ coincide numerically under the Euclidean metric, they live in dual spaces: velocity in $T\E$, momentum in $T^*\E$. This distinction is crucial when $\E$ is curved or equipped with a non-trivial metric (e.g., Fisher information), which encodes sensitivity of meaning to context perturbations.

If we replace the Euclidean metric with the Fisher information metric derived from the underlying language model, then $g_q$ encodes how sensitive meaning is to small changes in context. In this case, momentum becomes curvature-aware, yielding a more faithful representation of semantic dynamics in non-uniform embedding spaces.

\section{Recovering the Thermodynamic Quantities}
With the geometric structure in place, we define physical analogs using the canonical ensemble. Starting from the density $\rho(q)$, we derive all thermodynamic quantities—temperature, energy, entropy, pressure—as interpretable measures of linguistic behavior.

\subsection{Key Idea \#3: Canonical Ensemble}
We assume the system is in thermal equilibrium, allowing us to define a canonical ensemble over semantic states. The probability density $\rho(q)$ plays a foundational role: it quantifies how frequently different regions of $\E$ are occupied. High-density regions correspond to common, coherent, or stylistically typical meanings (e.g., standard syntactic patterns, frequent topics), while low-density areas represent rare, idiosyncratic, or disfluent constructions.

Thus, $\rho(q)$ serves as a direct proxy for \textit{semantic plausibility}, and through the relation $V(q) = -\frac{1}{\beta} \log \rho(q)$, it defines the underlying potential landscape that governs the motion of the semantic particle.

\subsubsection{Semantic Density $\rho(q)$}
The probability density $\rho(q)$ is estimated empirically from the sequence of sliding-window embeddings $q_t = f(\vect{v}[t:t+N])$, treated as samples from an unknown distribution. This density reflects the empirical likelihood of encountering a particular semantic state $q$ throughout the text.

High $\rho(q)$ regions are ``semantic basins''—stable, meaningful configurations such as recurring themes or coherent arguments. Low $\rho(q)$ regions are disfluent or unstable, corresponding to syntactic errors, contradictions, or abrupt topic shifts.

\subsubsection{Key Idea \#4: Estimating $\rho(q)$}
To estimate $\rho(q)$ empirically:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Compute embeddings: $q_t = f(\vect{v}[t:t+N])$.
\item (Optional) Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, UMAP, autoencoders).
\item Estimate $\rho(q)$ using KDE, GMM, or $k$-NN density estimation.
\end{enumerate}

When applying this framework, it is imperative to verify that the metric and density choices do not arbitrarily change the physics of the system. Likelihood-based analysis can help validate the estimated distribution under the equilibrium assumption.

\subsection{Dimensionality $d$}
The ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^d$, but dynamics are likely confined to a lower-dimensional manifold $\M \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{eff}}}$ due to linguistic constraints—grammar, topic coherence, and style.

\subsubsection{Key Idea \#5: Dimensionality Reduction}
Define a smooth map $\pi: \E \to \M$. The projected trajectory $q_\M(t) = \pi(q(t))$ evolves in $\M$. The effective dimension $d_{\text{eff}} = \dim(\M)$ replaces $d$ in thermodynamic formulas, mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

Using $d_{\text{eff}}$ ensures that thermodynamic quantities reflect only the dynamically active degrees of freedom—the true number of independent ways in which meaning can evolve. Throughout, $d$ should be interpreted as $d_{\text{eff}}$, regardless of the nominal size of the embedding space.

\subsection{Semantic Volume $\Vsem$}
$\Vsem$ represents the effective extent of $\E$ explored by the semantic particle:
\[
\Vsem = \int_{\E} dq \, \chi_\epsilon(q),
\]
where $\chi_\epsilon(q) = 1$ if $\rho(q) > \epsilon$, else $0$. Alternatively, $\Vsem$ can be the volume of $\{ q \mid V(q) \leq E \}$ for energy $E$.

Unlike physical volume, $\Vsem$ generalizes the notion of ``available space'' to the $d$-dimensional abstract space of meaning. A large $\Vsem$ indicates broad exploration—diverse topics or styles; a small $\Vsem$ suggests focused discourse.

This generalization is mathematically consistent with statistical mechanics, where phase space volumes are routinely defined in high-dimensional spaces. The semantic volume plays the same thermodynamic role as physical volume: it serves as the conjugate variable to pressure.

\subsubsection{Algorithm for $\Vsem$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose threshold $\epsilon > 0$.
\item Estimate region where $\rho(q) > \epsilon$ (via parametrization or Monte Carlo).
\item Compute:
\[
\boxed{\Vsem = \int_{\E} dq \, \chi_\epsilon(q)}
\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Potential Energy $V(q)$}

The potential $V(q)$ represents a semantic landscape that guides the dynamics of meaning in text. It is a scalar field on $\mathcal{E}$ representing "semantic landscape" features—e.g. topic attractors, conceptual basins, or stylistic preferences. It can be recovered using the empirical density of the discrete semantic vectors in the corpus (e.g., via \textit{kernel density estimation}). Under the Gibbs-Boltzmann hypothesis:

\[
V(q, \beta) = -\frac{1}{\beta} \log \rho(q),
\]
with $\beta = 1/T$, and $k_B = 1$ (natural units). High-density regions appear as low-potential ``semantic basins,'' while rare constructions sit in high-potential hills.

\subsubsection{Recipe for $V(q)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $q(t)$ via sliding window and interpolation.
\item Estimate $\rho(q)$ (e.g., with KDE).
\item Compute:
\[
\boxed{V(q, T) = -T \log \rho(q)}
\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hamiltonian}
Kinetic energy (velocity form):
\[
E_{\text{kin}}(t) = \frac{1}{2} m |\dot{q}(t)|^2_g.
\]
Momentum form:
\[
E_{\text{kin}}(t) = \frac{1}{2m} |p(t)|^2_{g^{-1}}.
\]
Thus, the Hamiltonian is:
\[
H(q,p) = \frac{1}{2m} |p|^2_{g^{-1}} + V(q).
\]

\subsection{Partition Function $Z(\beta)$}

To transition from deterministic dynamics to statistical behavior, we introduce the \textit{partition function}, the cornerstone of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It aggregates the contributions of all possible semantic states $(q, p)$, weighted by their likelihood under the Hamiltonian $H(q, p)$.

In thermal equilibrium:
\[
Z(\beta) = \int_{T^*\E} dq\,dp\, e^{-\beta H(q,p)}.
\]
With Euclidean metric and factorized Hamiltonian:
\[
Z(\beta) = \left( \int dp\, e^{-\beta |p|^2/(2m)} \right) \left( \int dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)} \right).
\]
The momentum integral is Gaussian:
\[
\int dp\, e^{-\beta |p|^2/(2m)} = \left( \frac{2\pi m}{\beta} \right)^{d/2}.
\]
So:
\[
Z(\beta) = \left( \frac{2\pi m}{\beta} \right)^{d/2} \int_{\E} dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)}.
\]
Using the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_B = \sqrt{\beta / (2\pi m)}$:
\[
Z(\beta) = \frac{1}{\lambda_B^d} \int_{\E} dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)}.
\]

\subsection{Free Energy $F(\beta)$}
From the partition function, we derive the \textit{Helmholtz free energy}, which governs the thermodynamic balance between energy and uncertainty:
\[
F(\beta) = -\frac{1}{\beta} \log Z(\beta) = \langle H \rangle - T S.
\]
It balances semantic coherence (low $V$) and diversity (high $S$)—a natural trade-off between staying on-topic and exploring related ideas.

\subsubsection{Recipe for $F(T)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate $Z(T)$ (via parametrization or Monte Carlo).
\item Compute:
\[
\boxed{F(T) = -T \log Z}
\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Internal Energy $U$}

The internal energy—the \textit{average semantic energy}—is:
\[
U = \langle H \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \log Z(\beta).
\]
From the factorized $Z(\beta)$:
\[
\log Z(\beta) = \frac{d}{2} \log(2\pi m) - \frac{d}{2} \log \beta + \log \left( \int dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)} \right),
\]
so:
\[
U = \frac{d}{2\beta} + \frac{\int dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)} V(q)}{\int dq\, e^{-\beta V(q)}} = \langle K \rangle + \langle V \rangle.
\]
This recovers equipartition, which will prove useful later: $\langle K \rangle = \frac{d}{2} T$.

On the other hand, the average potential energy $\langle V \rangle$ depends on the shape of $V(q)$ and the temperature. At low $T$, $\langle V \rangle$ approaches the global minimum of $V(q)$; at high $T$, it flattens toward the average over $\mathcal{E}$.

This allows us to \textit{measure semantic temperature} directly from observed kinetic energy: a text with high $\|\dot{q}(t)\|$ variance is "hot"; one that stays near a topic center is "cold".


\subsubsection{Recipe for $U(T)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\langle V \rangle$ (Monte Carlo or parametrization).
\item Compute $\langle K \rangle = \frac{d}{2} T$.
\item Add:
\[
\boxed{U(T) = \langle K \rangle + \langle V \rangle}
\]
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Entropy $S$}
The \textit{Gibbs entropy} quantifies the uncertainty or diversity of semantic states of the ensemble. It is defined as the expectation of the negative log-density:
\[
S = -\int dq\,dp\, \rho(q,p) \log \rho(q,p), \quad \rho(q,p) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta H}.
\]
Then:
\[
S = \beta \langle H \rangle + \log Z = \frac{\langle H \rangle - F}{T}.
\]
High entropy corresponds to \textit{semantic diversity}—a text that explores many topics or styles. Low entropy indicates \textit{focus or redundancy}, such as repetitive reasoning or narrow discourse. This makes entropy a natural metric for analyzing genre, authorial style, or model behavior.

\subsubsection{Formula for $S(T)$}
\[
\boxed{S(T) = \frac{U(T) - F(T)}{T}}
\]

\subsection{Semantic Pressure $P$}
Building on the definition of $\mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}}$, we define \textit{semantic pressure} $P$ as the thermodynamic conjugate of volume in the canonical ensemble. It quantifies the tendency of the semantic system to expand its scope of meaning in response to confinement.

In the canonical ensemble, the partition function $Z(\beta, \mathcal{V}_{\text{sem}})$ depends on both the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/T$ and the accessible semantic volume. The semantic pressure is then given by:
\[
P(\beta) = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \Vsem} \log Z(\beta, \Vsem).
\]
This measures how sensitive the system's free energy is to changes in the available semantic space. A high $P$ indicates strong resistance to confinement—a "drive" to explore new meanings—while a low $P$ suggests contentment within a limited conceptual domain.

For a free semantic particle (i.e., $V(q) = 0$) in $d$-dimensions with Euclidean metric, the partition function factorizes as:
\[
Z = \frac{\Vsem}{\lambda_B^d} \implies \log Z = \log \Vsem + \text{const},
\]
so:
\[
P = \frac{1}{\beta \Vsem} = \frac{T}{\Vsem}.
\]
This gives the \textit{semantic ideal gas law}:
\[
P \Vsem = T.
\]
High $P$: resistance to confinement (creative tension); low $P$: stagnation.

\subsubsection{Formula for $P(T)$}
Empirically, $P$ can be estimated as:
\[
\boxed{P(T) \approx \frac{T}{\Vsem}}
\]
where $T = \frac{2}{d} \langle K \rangle$ is the semantic temperature and $V_{\text{sem}}$ is computed from the support of $q(t)$. Applications include detecting narrative build-up (rising $P$) or diagnosing stagnation (low $P$ despite high $T$).

Thus, \textit{semantic pressure} completes the core thermodynamic triad—$T$, $S$, $P$—and enables a richer analysis of linguistic dynamics as a driven, expansive process.


\subsection{Specific Heat $C_V$}
The specific heat at constant volume, denoted $C_V$, is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that measures the system’s ability to absorb energy in response to a change in temperature. In physical systems, it characterizes thermal inertia; in our framework, it quantifies the resistance of a semantic system to changes in agitation (temperature).

We define $C_V$ as the rate of change of the average energy with respect to temperature:
\[
C_V = \frac{\partial \langle H \rangle}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{T^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta^2} \log Z(\beta) = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(H)}{T^2}.
\]
This is a key result in \textit{Statistical Mechanics}: the specific heat is proportional to the fluctuations in energy.

As for interpretation, a high $C_V$ suggests that the system can absorb large changes in temperature with minimal disruption to its average energy — it is \textit{thermally stable}. On the other hand, a low $C_V$ means the system is sensitive to temperature changes — small increases in $T$ cause large increases in $\langle H \rangle$, indicating \textit{semantic fragility}. In linguistic terms, a coherent, well-structured text (e.g., a logical argument) may have high $C_V$: it resists thermal agitation and maintains stability even as $T$ increases.

\subsubsection{Recipe for $C_V(T)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\mathrm{Var}(H) = \langle H^2 \rangle - \langle H \rangle^2$.
\item Compute:
\[
\boxed{C_V(T) = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(H)}{T^2}}
\]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Locking Everything into Place}
We managed, so far, to express several physical quantities as a function of temperature $T$. If we could measure even one of them, we would be able to lock the temperature, and thus, every other quantity.


\subsection{Method 1: Measuring Average Kinetic Energy}

We can measure the average kinetic energy, $\braket K$, by first calculating the instantaneous kinetic energy at each point along the semantic trajectory and then averaging these values.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate embeddings: $q_t = f(\vect{v}[t:t+N])$.
\item Compute semantic velocity: $\dot{q}_t \approx q_{t+1} - q_t$.
\item Instantaneous kinetic energy: $K_t = \frac{1}{2} m |\dot{q}_t|_g^2$.
\item Compute the average: $\langle K \rangle = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n K_t$.
\item Compute temperature:
\[
\boxed{T = \frac{2}{d} \langle K \rangle}
\]
\end{enumerate}
Though this method is the most obvious choice to find the temperature, and therefore all the other thermodynamical quantities, it is susceptible to the choice of the discrete time derivative algorithm, which, in the context of *Brownian motion* may be ill-defined. 


\subsection{Method 2: Measuring Entropy}
\subsubsection{Key Idea \#6: Locking via Entropy}
By estimating the entropy of the system with the \textit{Lempel-Ziv Complexity}, $S(T) \approx S_{LZ}$, and inverting the formula for entropy, we can obtain the temperature $\hat T=T(S_{LZ})$. Finally, we plug our estimate of the temperature $\hat T$ into all the other quantities to lock them into place.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $S(T)$ as above.
\item Invert to get $T(S)$.
\item Estimate $S_{\text{LZ}}$ from token sequence.
\item Set $\hat{T} = T(S_{\text{LZ}})$.
\item Use $\hat{T}$ to compute all other quantities.
\end{enumerate}
Now you may go back and plug this value of the temperature to get the estimate of all other thermodynamical quantities.


\section{Hypotheses}
\subsection{Ergodic Hypothesis}

\textbf{Time averages along a single trajectory equal ensemble averages over phase space.}

In physics, the long-time trajectory of a system explores all accessible regions of phase space uniformly, so the average of a quantity over time equals its average over all possible states.
Similarly, in semantics, we assume that the evolution $(q(t), p(t))$ of a single long text (e.g., a novel) samples the full distribution of semantic states characteristic of its genre, author, or theme.

This is crucial for empirical work: it allows us to treat one book as a proxy for the "statistical behavior" of a writer or genre. Importantly, real texts may violate ergodicity (e.g., narratives have irreversible arcs, authors shift style), suggesting \textit{non-equilibrium statistical mechanics} may be more appropriate in some cases.

\subsection{Equal A-Priori Probability Hypothesis}
\textbf{In equilibrium, all accessible microstates consistent with the system’s energy and constraints are equally probable.}

In physics, for an isolated system in equilibrium, the probability density $\rho(q,p)$ is uniform over the energy shell $H(q,p) = E$. Equivalently, in semantics, over a long text or corpus in a "stationary" semantic regime (e.g., consistent topic or style), all meaning states that are semantically coherent and dynamically accessible should be equally likely under the model.

This justifies using the \textit{microcanonical ensemble}, where entropy is defined as:
$$
S = k_B \log \Omega
$$
with $\Omega$ the volume of phase space occupied by states at fixed energy.

\subsection{Continuum Semantic Trajectory Hypothesis}
\textbf{The trajectory of the semantic vector can be treated as a partial observation of an underlying continuous trajectory.}

By interpolating over time $t$ the discrete embeddings $q_t = f(\mathbf{v}[t:t+N])$ obtained in a sliding window fashion, we get a smooth curve $q(t): \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathcal{E}$. The assumption that this \textit{lifting} can be done without changing the trajectory in a meaningful way opens the door to computing the \textit{momentum} of the particle, which in turn will unlock all the operators and functionals used in \textit{Lagrangian mechanics}.

\subsection{Equilibrium Hypothesis}
\textbf{We assume that the gas we are studying is at equilibrium. In principle, equilibrium occurs when the distribution of embeddings $\rho$ of any (reasonably) small portion of the text is similar to the distribution of the entire corpus.}

This hypothesis may not hold in general, and it's an interesting question whether it may be relaxed. In any case, to improve the stability, it should be a good idea to split the text based on meaning and study each chunk individually. 

\subsection{Constant Inertia Hypothesis}
\textbf{The mass of the semantic particle is constant.}
This hypothesis is necessary to study the system with the tools of *Statistical Mechanics*. 

\subsection{Hypothesis on Entropy}
One way to lock the value of temperature into place through entropy is to assume that we can measure the entropy of the system directly from the list of tokens with the \textit{Lempel-Ziv Complexity}, $S(T) \approx S_{LZ}$.

This bridge between the two types of entropy is just an approximation, and, in the future, a better trick may be found to lock the thermodynamic quantities into place.


\section{Other Thoughts}
\subsection{Diffusion and Stochastic Dynamics}
Natural language and LLMs exhibit stochasticity. To model noise, drift, or creativity, we introduce a stochastic differential equation:
\[
dq(t) = \dot{q}(t)\,dt, \quad d\dot{q}(t) = F(q,\dot{q})\,dt + \sigma\, dW_t,
\]
where $F = -\nabla V$ is deterministic force, and $W_t$ is Wiener noise. This leads to a Fokker–Planck equation for $\rho(q,\dot{q},t)$, describing how semantic uncertainty spreads.

\subsection{Why Do LLMs Tend to Get Stuck?}
LLMs often repeat tokens—``getting stuck'' in a semantic potential well. Adding noise reduces looping, suggesting a balance between kinetic energy and potential depth.

\subsubsection{Key Idea \#7: Critical Temperature $T_{\text{crit}}$}
We propose that by analyzing thermodynamic behavior before looping occurs, we can estimate a safety threshold $T_{\text{crit}}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Study $K_{\text{avg}}(T^{(model)})$ from generated text.
\item From looping examples, estimate well depth $\hat{V}$ and kinetic energy $\hat{K}$ at the critical point.
\item Set $K_{\text{crit}} = \hat{V}$.
\item Invert to get:
\[
T_{\text{crit}} = T^{(model)}(K_{\text{crit}})
\]
\end{enumerate}
Above $T_{\text{crit}}$, kinetic energy overcomes potential barriers, breaking loops.

\section{Conclusion}
Semantic Dynamics provides a principled framework for analyzing LLM behavior through statistical mechanics. By mapping token sequences to trajectories in a latent energy landscape, we derive thermodynamic quantities that diagnose and mitigate degenerate generation. We estimate a critical temperature $T_{\text{crit}}$, above which models escape semantic wells. This offers a new path toward more coherent, diverse, and stable language model outputs.

The analogy of a ``semantic particle'' moving through meaning space transforms abstract language into a physical-like system, enabling diagnosis via temperature, pressure, and entropy. Future work includes non-equilibrium extensions, curvature-aware metrics, and applications to style transfer and cognitive modeling.

\section{Other Ideas}
\textbf{Canonical Transformations:} Apply $(q,p) \mapsto (Q,P)$ preserving symplectic structure. Useful for style transfer or paraphrasing. \\
\textbf{Semantic Potential Landscapes:} Map long texts into energy landscapes; identify topic clusters (wells) and transitions (barriers). \\
\textbf{Semantic Turbulence:} Analyze power spectrum of $p(t)$ or $\dot{q}(t)$; high frequencies may indicate cognitive load or emotional intensity.
